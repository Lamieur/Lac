=== Platforms

--- Envy 2.2

These platforms have been directly ported:

	Generic PC	x86	Linux 1.2.8	-Use Standard Makefile
	Generic PC	x86	Linux 2.+	-Use Makefile.lnx
	Generic PC	x86	Windows 95/NT	-Read README.WIN
	Sequent		S81	Dynix		-Use Standard Makefile
	DEC		5900	Ultrix V4.3A	-Use Standard Makefile
	DEC Alpha	OSF			-Use Makefile.osf
	Any IRIX Machine	IRIX 5.1.1.2	-Use Makefile.irx
	HP		9000	Hp/UX		-Use Makefile.hp
	Sequent		sysv			-Use Makefile.sys
	Sparc		10	Solaris 2.*	-Use Makefile.sol
	Sparc		20	Sun OS 4.1.4	-Use Standard Makefile
	Amiga			Amiga OS	-Use Makefile.ami


These have not been tested for the Envy 2.2 release:

	IBM		RS/6000	Aix 3.0		-Use Makefile.aix
	Mips		R4000	Risc/OS 5.XX    -Use Makefile.mip
	NeXT		68040	Ultrix		-Use Makefile.nex
	Tektronix	xd88s	utek 3.2e	-Use Makefile.tek

If you have gcc on your system, it would be best to try the standard Makefile
first.  If you have cc on your system, it would be best to try the standard
Makefile with gcc replaced with cc.

The standard version of gcc as of this release is gcc 2.7.0

We are simply unable to test Envy on every platform.  Typically a user tries
a new platform, gets a file full of warnings, and mails us the warnings.
We fix the base code; on the next release we ask that users mail us the
new warnings (usually we never hear from the user again).



=== Requirements

The hardware requirements are essentially: two megabytes of memory; five
megabytes of disk space; any 32-bit processor; 50 kilobits per second network
bandwidth.  Processor speed is not important.

The software requirements are essentially: a C compiler; a Unix or
Unix-like operating system; BSD-compatible TCP/IP networking.

Envy uses 32-bit integers and is casual about the distinction between 'int' and
'long'.  (It is possible to clean up the code to run with 16-bit integers, but
the demand is nonexistent, and we don't have any 16-bit C compilers with which
to test.)  If you are running on a personal computer, make sure your C compiler
is giving you 32-bit integers and not running in 16-bit mode.

Area files, player files, the note file, and the bugs/ideas/typo files are all
in ASCII format, so that they may be freely moved from one machine type to
another.



=== Performance

All this measured on a 486 DX4 100 mHz running Linux 1.2.8

Boot time:    5 CPU seconds.
Memory:       4409 bytes SZ size.
CPU usage:    1.2 CPU minutes per hour + 1-2 CPU seconds per player.
Disk space:   6 megabytes plus 10K per player file.
IP packets:   about 10 per second with 20 people logged in.

This has improved from Envy 1.0 by about 25% overall.
