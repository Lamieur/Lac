=== Immortal commands

Because Envy treats the immortal commands as skills, immortal characters
can be tailored by the Implementor Director depending on what commands
the Director feels they should have the capability to perform.  Below is
a list of the base level necessary for the use of a given command.  In
order to access a given command, the player must have the command name string
in the Immskll field.

=== How to create your first immortal.

There is no automatic way to create immortals on a virgin Envy
package.  The only way to do this is to use your favorite text editor
and edit your immortal.

1)  Go to the player directory and choose an immortal name.  Ie) Immortal

2)  Change directory to the first initial of the immortal's name.  Ie) cd i.

3)  Use an editor to create your immortal.  Ie) emacs Immortal

4)  Put this into the file:

#PLAYER
Nm	Immortal~
Lvl	54
Immskll	imtlset advance ~
End

#END

5)  Save and exit your editor and that is it.  Next time you log on,
you'll have a DIRECTOR ready to go.

See 'pfile.txt' for more information.
