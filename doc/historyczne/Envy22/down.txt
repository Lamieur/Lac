This file gives instructions on how to create a TIME.TXT file suitable to
get the mud server to autoshutdown or autoreboot.



=== TIME.TXT

The TIME.TXT file is simple to create.  With your favorite text editor,
edit a file named TIME.TXT.  In it, you declare the time you wish your
two warnings to go off and when the mud is to shutdown.

The format for the files is such:

HOUR
<hours:number>

MINUTE
<minutes:number>

REBOOT

HOUR represent how many hours since bootup will the mud automatically
shutdown.  MINUTE represents how many minutes since bootup will the
mud automatically shutdown.  You may enter one or the other or both.
The code is smart enough to add together or ignore the appropriate
fields.  The mud will assume a minimum of 5 minutes of life should
TIME.TXT state less than 5 minutes.

The presence of REBOOT in the file notifies the mud that the user
wishes the mud to reboot instead of shutdown when the time elapses.

For example, you wish to shutdown the mud 1 hour and 14 minutes after
bootup.  Then your TIME.TXT file should look like this:

HOUR
1

MINUTE
14


The mud checks the time every game pulse and compares the numerical
value of the current time and the warning/down times.  Should they
occur, the mud will issue the proper warning or shutdown command.

There is an online command called SSTIME that sets the warnings and downtime
from within the game.  The changes to these values internally will not save
over game reboots.  For more permanent settings, editing the TIME.TXT file is
more desirable.
